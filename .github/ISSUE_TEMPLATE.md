#### Bug reports

If it looks like a local environment issue, please try to debug yourself. Debugging local setup issues is not our top priority.

Before opening an issue, please try to reproduce the issue on latest master. The bug you noticed might have already been fixed.

If the issue can be reproduced on master, please make sure you provide the following:

- exact steps to reproduce the issue
- details of operating system, desktop environment, terminal emulator and shell

If we need more information and there is no communication from the bug reporter within 7 days from the date of request, we will close the issue. If you have relevant information, resume discussion any time.

#### Feature requests

Please consider contributing the feature back to `nnn` yourself. Feel free to discuss in the ToDo list thread. We are more than happy to help.

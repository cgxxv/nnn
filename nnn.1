Backing up one directory level will set the cursor position at the
directory you came out of.
.Sh CONFIGURATION
.Nm
is configured by modifying
.Pa config.h
and recompiling the code.
.Pp
Environment variable
.Ar NNN_OPENER
overrides all hard-coded file associations.
.Pp
Hard-coded associations are specified by regexes matching on the currently selected filename. If a match is found the associated program is executed with the filename passed in as the argument. If no match is found the environment variable
.Ar NNN_FALLBACK_OPENER
is invoked, if set.
.Pp
No particular utility is set as the default opener as no standalone universal opener for all mime types exists.
.Pp
See the examples section below for more information.
.Sh FILTERS
Filters support regexes to display only the matched
entries in the current directory view.  This effectively allows
searching through the directory tree for a particular entry.
.Pp
Filters do not stack on top of each other.  They are applied anew
every time.
.Pp
To reset the filter you can input an empty filter expression.
.Pp
If
.Nm
is invoked as root the default filter will also match hidden
files.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The SHELL, EDITOR and PAGER environment variables take precedence
when dealing with the !, e and p commands respectively.
.Pp
\fBNNN_OPENER:\fR set to your desktop environment's default
mime opener to override all custom mime associations.
.br
Examples: xdg-open, gnome-open, gvfs-open.
.Pp
\fBNNN_FALLBACK_OPENER:\fR set to your desktop environment's default
mime opener to use as a fallback when no association is set for a file
type. Custom associations are listed in the EXAMPLES section below.
.Pp
\fBNNN_COPIER:\fR set to a clipboard copier script. For example, on Linux:
.Bd -literal
        -------------------------------------
        #!/bin/sh

        echo -n $1 | xsel --clipboard --input
        -------------------------------------
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following example shows one possible configuration for
file associations which is also the default if environment
variable NNN_OPENER is not set:
.Bd -literal
        -----------------------------------------------
        struct assoc assocs[] = {
	        { "\\.(c|cpp|h|txt|log|sh)$", "vi" },
	        { "\\.(wma|mp3|ogg|flac)$", "mpv" },
	        { "\\.pdf$", "zathura" },
        };
        -----------------------------------------------
Plain text files are opened with vi.
.br
Any other file types are opened with the 'xdg-open' command.
.Ed
.Sh KNOWN ISSUES
If you are using urxvt you might have to set backspacekey to DEC.

.Sh CONFIGURATION
.Nm
invokes
.Pa nlay
to play a file if it recognizes a file by extension.
.Pa nlay
is a
highly customizable bash shell script which invokes a player depending on the
type of file. Read more on
.Pa nlay
at:
.br
.Em https://github.com/jarun/nnn/wiki/all-about-nlay
.Pp
.Nm
is configured by modifying
.Pa config.def.h
and recompiling the code. config.h is generated as a backup of config.def.h.
.Pp
See the environment and examples sections below for more options and information.
.Pp
Configuring
.Nm
to change to the last visited directory on quit requires shell integration in a
few easy steps. Please visit the project page (linked below) for the
instructions.
.Sh FILTERS
Filters support regexes to display only the matched
entries in the current directory view.  This effectively allows
searching through the directory tree for a particular entry. Matching entries
are shown instantly (search-as-you-type).
.Pp
Filters do not stack on top of each other.  They are applied anew
every time. There are 4 ways to reset a filter:
.Pp
The \fIInsert\fR key, an empty filter expression, a search with no results or an
extra backspace at the filter prompt (like vi).
.Pp
If you want to list all matches starting with the filter expression (a common
use case), start the expression with a
.Pa ^
(caret) symbol.
.Pp
If
.Nm
is invoked as root the default filter will also match hidden files.
.Pp
In the navigate-as-you-type mode directories are opened in filter mode,
allowing instant navigation. Works best with the arrow keys.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The SHELL, EDITOR and PAGER environment variables take precedence
when dealing with the !, e and p commands respectively.
.Pp
\fBNNN_DE_FILE_MANAGER:\fR set to a desktop file manager to open the current
directory with.
.Pp
\fBNNN_OPENER:\fR set to your desktop environment's default
mime opener to override all custom mime associations.
.br
Examples: xdg-open, gio open, gvfs-open.
.Pp
\fBNNN_FALLBACK_OPENER:\fR set to your desktop environment's default
mime opener to use as a fallback when no association is set for a file
type. Custom associations are listed in the EXAMPLES section below.
.Pp
\fBNNN_COPIER:\fR set to a clipboard copier script. For example, on Linux:
.Bd -literal
        -------------------------------------
        #!/bin/sh

        echo -n $1 | xsel --clipboard --input
        -------------------------------------

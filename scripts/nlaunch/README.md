`nlaunch` is an independent POSIX-compliant GUI application launcher shell script. Its only dependency is `fzy`. It's possible to set a keyboard shortcut to open `nlaunch` in a terminal and use it as the regular launcher.

To use `nlaunch` as an independent launcher add a keybind to open `nlaunch` in a terminal e.g.

    xfce4-terminal -e nlaunch
